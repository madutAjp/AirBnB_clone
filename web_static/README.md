A static website is a type of website that is delivered to the user's browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic websites which are generated by a web application. Static websites are typically faster and more secure because they do not require server-side processing. They are composed of fixed content and display the same information to every visitor, regardless of who they are or what they do on the site.

Key characteristics of static websites include:

Fixed Content: Static websites contain fixed content that does not change in response to user actions or input.
Speed: They are known for their fast load times because there is no server-side processing required.
Security: They are generally more secure than dynamic websites since they do not interact with databases or user input.
Low Maintenance: Updating static websites is a straightforward process that involves changing the source files directly.
To build a static website, you would typically use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. However, modern static websites often use static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, or Publii to simplify the development process and to enable features like automatic code minification, optimization, and deployment 

When building a static website, it's important to follow best practices to ensure a good user experience and maintainable code:

Design: Focus on a clear navigation structure, use web fonts responsibly, implement a favicon, and follow accessibility best practices.
Content: Use clear and concise content that is regularly reviewed and updated.
Development: Choose the right static site generator and use semantic HTML.
Deployment: Implement SSL encryption, optimize images, include a sitemap, and host your website on a static site hosting service like Tiiny.host
